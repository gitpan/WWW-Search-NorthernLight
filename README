NorthernLight.pm Version 2.06.


This class is a NorthernLight specialization of WWW::Search.
It handles making and interpreting NorthernLight searches
F<http://www.northernlight.com>.

Northern Light supports full Boolean capability (AND,
OR, NOT), including parenthetical "expressions", in
all searches. There is no limit to the level of nesting
which you can use in a query.  

This class exports no public interface; all interaction should
be done through L<WWW::Search> objects.





See Also WWW::Search documentation. For all the latest
current fixed backends see:
